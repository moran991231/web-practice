    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript(/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weekly typed,
        prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        and interpreted programming language. Along HTML and CSs, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of
        World Wide Web content production.
        It is used to make webpages interactie and probide online programmers, including videogames.
        The majority of websites employ it, and al lmodern web browers support it without the need for plug-ins by means
        of a built-in JavaScript engine.
        Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementataion of JavaScript, all based on the
        ECMAScript specifications,
        with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with any engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA
