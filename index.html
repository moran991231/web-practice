    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources
        are identified
        by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.
        [1]English sientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
        He wrote the first web brower computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.
        [2][3] The Web brower was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other reseearch institutions
        starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
